            <h1>Pain is Unbearable: Shooter Arjun Babuta after Finishing Fourth at Olympics</h1>
            <img src="./resources/arjun.png" alt="Arjun Babuta" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
            <p>Indian shooter Arjun Babuta expressed his disappointment after narrowly missing out on a podium finish at
                the Olympics, where he finished fourth in the men's 10m air rifle event.</p>
            <p>In an emotional statement, Babuta said, "The pain is unbearable. To come so close and not secure a medal
                is heartbreaking. I gave it my all, but it just wasn't enough today."</p>
            <p>Babuta's performance in the qualifying rounds was strong, but he fell short in the final, finishing just
                outside the medal positions. Despite the setback, he remains determined to continue his journey in the
                sport and aims to come back stronger in future competitions.</p>
            <p>"This is not the end. I will analyze where I went wrong and work even harder. My focus now is on
                improving my performance and preparing for the next challenge," Babuta added.</p>
            <p>The young shooter has been a rising star in Indian shooting sports, and this Olympic experience, though
                painful, will undoubtedly fuel his future ambitions.</p>
            <p>Babuta's experience is not unique. Joydeep Karmakar faced a similar disappointment, finishing fourth in
                the 50m rifle prone event at the 2012 London Olympics.</p>
            <p>Abhinav Bindra, the only Indian shooter to win Olympic gold, also ended up in fourth place in the Rio
                2016 Olympics in the same event that saw Babuta's heartbreak. Bindra was among the first to console
                Babuta after the disappointment at the Chateauroux Shooting Centre.
                "He told me that fourth place will make me stronger and that it was important to move on. Whether you
                laugh it off or do something else, he told me to take it with a smile and move," said Babuta, who did
                well to regain his composure and speak to the travelling Indian media.</p>
