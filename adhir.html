            <h1>Adhir Officially Out, Congress Looks at Changes in Bengal, May Rethink Ties with TMC in State</h1>
            <img src="./resources/adhir.png" alt="Congress in Bengal" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
            <p>In a significant political development, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has officially been removed from his
                position as the President of the West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee (WBPCC). This move comes as part
                of a broader strategy by the Indian National Congress to reassess its political strategy in West Bengal,
                including its alliance with the Trinamool Congress (TMC).</p>
            <p>The Congress party's decision to replace Chowdhury signals a potential shift in its approach to politics
                in the state, where it has been struggling to make a significant impact against the dominant TMC led by
                Mamata Banerjee. Sources within the party suggest that the leadership is considering major changes to
                its strategy, which could include a reevaluation of its current alliance with the TMC.</p>
            <p>There has been growing speculation about whether the Congress will continue its alliance with the TMC or
                seek new political partnerships. The decision to reconsider ties with the TMC comes in the wake of
                several setbacks for the Congress in the state, including poor performance in recent elections and
                internal party conflicts.</p>
            <p>The Congress leadership is expected to conduct a thorough review of its political strategies and
                alliances as it seeks to strengthen its position in West Bengal. The outcome of this review could have
                significant implications for the political landscape in the state, as well as for the Congress party's
                overall strategy in the upcoming elections.</p>
            <p>As the situation evolves, both political analysts and party supporters are keenly watching to see how the
                Congress will navigate this challenging period and what new directions it may take in West Bengal.</p>
