            <h1>Coach Jaspal Rana details how life-work balance helped Manu Bhaker win two Olympic medals</h1>
            <img src="./resources/sports.png" alt="Manu Bhaker and Coach Jaspal Rana" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
            <p>Manu Bhaker's remarkable performance at the Paris Olympics, where she won two bronze medals, has been the
                talk of the nation. Behind her success is the meticulous guidance of her coach, Jaspal Rana, who
                emphasizes the importance of maintaining a life-work balance in the pursuit of excellence.</p>
            <p>In an exclusive interview, Coach Rana shared how the young shooter’s ability to manage stress and stay
                focused, both on and off the shooting range, played a crucial role in her success. “Manu is not just a
                talented shooter, but she’s also exceptionally disciplined when it comes to balancing her personal life
                with her professional responsibilities,” said Rana.</p>
            <p>According to Rana, the key to Bhaker’s achievements lies in her routine. “We made sure that her training
                schedule allowed her enough time to unwind and engage in activities she enjoys. This helped her stay
                mentally fresh and perform consistently under pressure,” he added.</p>
            <p>Rana also highlighted the role of family support in Bhaker's journey. “Her family has been incredibly
                supportive, understanding the demands of her career and helping her manage the highs and lows of
                competitive sports,” he said.</p>
            <p>The coach believes that the holistic approach to training, which includes physical conditioning, mental
                health support, and personal development, is essential for any athlete aiming for the top. “It’s not
                just about the hours you put in at the range; it’s also about how you manage your time outside of it,”
                he noted.</p>
            <p>With two Olympic medals in her kitty, Bhaker is now focused on the next challenge, but Coach Rana insists
                that the approach will remain the same. “We’ll continue to focus on the process, not just the outcomes.
                The medals are a byproduct of the hard work she puts in every day,” he concluded.</p>
