            <h1>AMD Raises Forecast for AI Chip Revenue and Sees Supplies Remaining Tight</h1>
            <img src="./resources/amd.png" alt="AMD AI Chips" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
            <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has raised its revenue forecast for AI chips, anticipating a significant
                boost in sales as demand continues to surge. The company, which has been gaining ground in the AI chip
                market, now expects its AI chip revenue to increase by more than 20% in the coming quarter.</p>
            <p>This optimistic outlook comes despite ongoing challenges in the global semiconductor supply chain.
                According to AMD, the demand for AI chips is outpacing supply, and the situation is expected to remain
                tight for the foreseeable future. “The growth in AI workloads is driving unprecedented demand for
                high-performance computing,” said AMD CEO Lisa Su during a recent earnings call.</p>
            <p>AMD’s AI chips are being utilized in a variety of applications, from data centers to autonomous vehicles.
                The company’s latest AI chip, the MI300, has received positive reviews for its performance and
                efficiency, further solidifying AMD's position in the competitive AI hardware market.</p>
            <p>However, the company faces stiff competition from industry giants like NVIDIA and Intel, who are also
                ramping up their AI chip offerings. To meet the increasing demand, AMD has been working closely with its
                manufacturing partners to boost production capacity.</p>
            <p>Despite these efforts, supply constraints are likely to persist. “We’re doing everything we can to
                increase output, but the reality is that the supply chain is still under pressure,” Su explained. AMD’s
                strategy involves prioritizing the production of AI chips to ensure that key customers receive the
                products they need to maintain their operations.</p>
            <p>The company’s strong performance in the AI sector is expected to contribute significantly to its overall
                revenue growth, even as it navigates the challenges of a constrained supply environment.</p>
            <p>"We are in the picks and shovels cycle which is more about hardware infrastructure right now," Creative
                Strategies CEO Ben Bajarin said, making an analogy to the California gold rush, where suppliers of
                mining tools profited more than some miners. "Most enterprises are spending on AI software but only to
                trial and pilot programs, (and have) not fully deploy them yet," he said.</p>
