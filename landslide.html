            <h1>Behind the Wayanad landslides: Extremely heavy rain, fragile ecology</h1>
            <img src="./resources/news1.png" alt="Wayanad landslide" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
            <p>Wayanad, a serene district in Kerala, has recently been devastated by a series of landslides. The death
                toll has alarmingly risen to 156, with many still trapped under the debris as rescue operations continue
                tirelessly. The landslides have been attributed to a combination of extremely heavy rainfall and the
                fragile ecology of the region.</p>
            <p>The region has witnessed unprecedented rainfall over the past few weeks, leading to saturation of the
                soil and eventually causing massive landslides. The fragile ecology of the Western Ghats, exacerbated by
                deforestation, unplanned construction, and poor land management practices, has significantly contributed
                to the disaster.</p>
            <p>The government has deployed several rescue teams, including the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF),
                to search for survivors and recover bodies. However, the challenging terrain and continuous rainfall are
                hampering the rescue efforts.</p>
            <p>Experts have long warned about the dangers of unchecked development in ecologically sensitive regions
                like Wayanad. The need for sustainable practices and stricter enforcement of environmental regulations
                has never been more evident.</p>
            <p>As the situation unfolds, the priority remains on rescuing those still trapped and providing relief to
                the affected families. The disaster serves as a grim reminder of the impact of climate change and the
                importance of preserving our natural environment.</p>
            <p><strong>LIVE Updates:</strong> The death toll continues to rise as rescue operations persist in the
                affected areas. The authorities have urged people to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel.</p>
