            <h1>Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s Son Pax Jolie-Pitt Suffers Head Injury in Bike Crash</h1>
            <img src="./resources/jolie.png" alt="Pax Jolie-Pitt" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
            <p>Pax Jolie-Pitt, the son of Hollywood actors Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, reportedly suffered a head
                injury following a bike crash over the weekend. The incident occurred while the 19-year-old was riding
                his bicycle in Los Angeles.</p>
            <p>According to sources close to the family, Pax was enjoying a casual ride when he lost control of his bike
                and took a hard fall. Bystanders quickly came to his aid and called emergency services. Pax was
                transported to a nearby hospital where he was treated for his injuries.</p>
            <p>The severity of the injury has not been disclosed, but it is understood that Pax is currently recovering
                at home. “It was a scary moment for everyone,” an insider said. “Angelina and Brad were both informed
                immediately and have been by his side through the entire ordeal.”</p>
            <p>Pax, who has largely stayed out of the public eye despite his famous parents, is known for his passion
                for the arts and photography. The family has asked for privacy as they focus on Pax's recovery.</p>
            <p>The incident has sparked conversations about bike safety, particularly in busy urban areas like Los
                Angeles. Experts recommend always wearing a helmet, following traffic rules, and being mindful of road
                conditions to prevent accidents.</p>
